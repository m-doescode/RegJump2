# RegJump2
My implementation of RegJump as a library
# Code Quality
I am still pretty new to coding in C++, so expect there to be lots of bad practice in my code.

Also does require C++ and cannot work with C due to usages of `wstring` for splitting and `vector` (although may be replaceable)
# How to use
Just download `regjump2.h` and use it in your project
